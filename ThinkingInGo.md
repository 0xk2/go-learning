# Thinking in Go

I am a Java person and OOP is the one I know from the very early day of my life so Go is a bit odd to me. You can use Go for OOP, but Go does not official support concepts such as inheritance or polymorphism.

## So, how to think in Go?

Oh, Inheritance is "trying to categorize things" while Go is more "tagging". 

Think of `struct` as defining the data structure and `interface` of defining the behavior of `something`, preferable call it `some code`.
